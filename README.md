# Stock Portfolio Project

This projects is a mock stock buying/selling platform that allows the user to use their funds to buy stocks and then sell them whenever they feel like it.


# Technologies Used

The platform uses React.JS as its front-end library, coupled with Bootsrap 5 for the styling and Redux for state management.

For the stocks data, two APIs* are used:

 - [Nasdaq API](api.nasdaq.com) used to fetch the stocks details based on user's input
 - [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) used for fetching price details for every stocks.
 
 *The API's give Internal CORS erros so in order to use the platform the user would need to install [Moesif CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) extension.
